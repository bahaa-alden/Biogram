400 bad request only for post because the error absolutely in the body
404 error maybe in the req body or params at the get method or update... because we use find
200 good get
201 create post

for read from config use (import config from dotenv) then give path to config and get to vars using process.env.var

We delete excluded fields from route because that affect on filtering
and we do that by coping the req.query and destructing them
and put them in queryObj and delete excluded fields from queryObj
by forEach on excluded array and delete queryObj[excludedFields]
Example:a{bahaa:2,s:5} and write delete a['bahaa'] and print(a)
the result will be {s:5}
